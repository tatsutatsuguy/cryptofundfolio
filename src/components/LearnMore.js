                                    <p class="mb-0">Bitcoin is a form of digital money that (1) exists independently of any government, state, or financial institution, (2) can be transferred globally without the need for a centralized intermediary, and (3) has a known monetary policy that arguably cannot be altered.  It is the first crypto currency and the most popular.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0">Like Bitcoin, Litecoin exists as a blockchain where participating nodes process transactions, and miners provide security and verification for each of those transactions.<br />

                                    Litecoin was originally conceived and developed by Charlie Lee in 2011. Since its launch in 2011 Litecoin has seen steady adoption with an active community of traders, merchants, and developers.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0">Cardano is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap. It’s designed to be a flexible, sustainable, and scalable blockchain platform for running smart contracts — which will allow the development of a wide range of decentralized finance apps, new crypto tokens, games, and more. </p>

                                    <h2 class="h5">Dogecoin</h2>
                                    <p class="mb-0">Dogecoin (DOGE) was created as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in 2013. The name and Shiba Inu logo are based on a meme. Unlike Bitcoin, which was designed to be scarce, Dogecoin is intentionally abundant — with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum supply.</p>
